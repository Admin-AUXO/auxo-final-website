# Astro Component Patterns

## Component Structure
- Use TypeScript for component scripts
- Define Props interface at the top
- Extract reusable logic to utilities
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Custom CSS in scoped `<style>` tags
- Import global styles from `@/styles/`
- Follow BEM conventions for custom CSS classes

## Data Fetching
- Content is stored in `@/data/content/` as TypeScript files
- Import data modules from `@/lib/data/`
- All data is statically imported at build time
- Handle loading states with skeleton components

## Performance
- Use `client:*` directives intentionally
- Prefer `client:visible` for below-fold content
- Lazy load images with `loading="lazy"`
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
