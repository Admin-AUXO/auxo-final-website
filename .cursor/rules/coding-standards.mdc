# AUXO Coding Standards

## ZERO-WASTE OUTPUT
- Provide only code that changes
- No unchanged functions or imports
- No comments except: complex logic, TODO, FIXME
- No docstrings unless class/public API
- No header comments (# ===, # Part 1, etc.)
- No inline explanations (# This does X, # Load data, etc.)
- No cell markers in .py files (# %% Cell 1, etc.)

## FILE CREATION
- NEVER create .md files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER create README, GUIDE, WORKFLOW, QUICK_START files
- Only create files the user asks for
- If context needed, put in code comments (minimal)

## DIRECT ACTION
- Execute immediately, no "I will..." or "Let me..."
- No explanations before tool calls
- Show results after completion only

## RESEARCH FIRST
- grep/read before writing code
- Web search for library docs (2026)
- Check file exists before modifying

## CODE STYLE
- Clean, readable code
- No redundant variables
- No excessive blank lines
- Minimal vertical space

## BATCHING
- Group related changes
- Don't commit after every edit
- Accumulate tasks, execute together
